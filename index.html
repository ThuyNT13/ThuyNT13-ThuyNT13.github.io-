				<h4>Germination</h4>
				<p>Prior to CSS as we now know it, web designers utilized tables to layout websites. But now, that practice has been slammed as being syntactically incorrect - to the point that people avoid using it even when it's the correct thing to do so, like assembling data into rows and columns. Admittedly, I am committing programming blaspheme by utilizing a table to frame my website, but seeing how we aren't at the CSS part of the lessons, yet, consider this a throwback to the 90's. Bring on the grunge.</p>
				<p>I was playing around with the tables assignment for Dev Bootcamp, trying to achieve the <strong>Golden Ratio</strong> of nesting boxes, and this just presented itself as a way to display information that's easy on the eye and has a natural flow.</p>
				<h4>Design</h4>
				<p>There's a semblance of <em>responsive design</em> to it. The table's dimensions conform horizontally to the screen size as the text area is quite fluid. The <em>img</em> above is what keeps it from scrunching further as it has a fixed dimension. But there are definite limitations. It would look better if both the side cells shifted to the bottom when viewed on a mobile. And that's not going to happen with the table tags.</p>
				<p>The best reasons for not using tables as layout are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tableless_web_design#Maintainability">upkeep</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tableless_web_design#Bandwidth_savings">bandwidth</a>. Making changes in just the CSS is much easier than searching through a complicated HTML page to find all the elements that need to be updated, so saving time for the web developer. The codes created in CSS in external style sheets allows for caching, saving on reloads and time for user to access the page. Also, many of these will most likely be deprecated and phased out in the future for CSS styling. </p>
				<h4>Progress</h4>
				<p>Nevertheless, it's a good visual layout upon which to base future projects, at least ones which are text-heavy. There are others to explore, like <a href="http://piira.se/projects/ingrid/">Ingrid CSS</a> which fluidly responds to various screen sizes, but this was a good test to block out how I want information to flow on a page.</p>
				<p>Next up is to create a <strong>Contact</strong> page which has a form for taking down people's emails (We just learned forms!) and also write an <strong>About</strong> page, my least favorite part.</p>
				<p>Most importantly, utilize CSS to recreate this page structure!</p>
