				<p>Prior to CSS as we now know it, web designers utilized tables to layout websites. But now that practice has been slammed as being syntactically incorrect - to the point that people avoid using it even when it's the correct thing to do so, like assembling data into rows and columns. Admittedly, I am committing programming blaspheme by utilizing a table to frame my website, but seeing how we aren't at the CSS part of the lessons, yet, consider this a throwback to the 90's. Bring on the grunge.</p>
				<p>I was playing around with the tables assignment, trying to achieve the Golden Ratio of nesting boxes, and this just presented itself as a way to display information that's easy on the eye and has a natural flow.</p>
				<p>There's an element of responsive design-ness to it as the table's dimensions conform horizontally to the screen size, as the text area is quite fluid. The img above is what keeps it from scrunching further as it has a fixed dimension. But there are definite limitations as it would look better if both the side cells moved to the bottom when viewed on a mobile. And that's not going to happen.</p>
				<p>It's a good layout upon which to base future projects, at least ones which are text-heavy. There are other frameworks to explore and I am presently exploring grid structures, like the Ingrid CSS which fluidly responds to various screen sizes, but this was a good test page to block out how I want information setup.</p>
