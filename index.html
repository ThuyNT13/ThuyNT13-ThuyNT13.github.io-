    <h4 class="title">Evolution</h4>
    <p>Some changes from the original table-layout idea as it's not so pretty to look at on mobile devices. It is a bit much to squeeze in that information onto a device that only spans your hand.</p>

    <h4 class="title">Progress</h4>
    <p>Able to figure out some button styles for links. Utilizing border-radius, background, and other little changes, made it stand out. Also, with the <em>a:hover</em> selector, gave buttons a <em>pop</em> when the cursor is over it. Still deciding on whether or not I like the box-shadow effect.</p>
    <p>Learned a lot about <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp">CSS selectors</a> and <a href="http://gottheknack.com/a_htmlCss/weeks/week9/combiningSelectors/combiningSelectors.html">combining them</a>. I can use <b>nav > a.btn:hover</b> to target only the buttons for <em>nav</em> elements for the exact hover modifications that I give it. It's a cleaner CSS, using classes sparingly and utilizing the elements that already exist. Took a while to finally discern relationship of descendant, parent, child and sibling elements. But now it make more sense.</p>

    <h4 class="title">More...</h4>
    <p>The main issue is trying to get my objects to align just where I want it to. Finally fixed social media links to become inline for media queries, I think. Centering is still a big hassle as <em>margin:auto</em> doesn't always work. Resisting <em>float</em> as the <em>display</em> property has so much potential for futzing with. Plus with <em>display</em>, I can play with <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">flexbox</a>!</p>
    <p>Getting rid of the ugly default styles for links cause the them to disappear into the text. Present solution feels clutzy. Possibly overkill with button styles.</p>
    <p>Need to explore more <em>responsive design</em> techniques. Finding optimal font and image sizes for <em>readibility</em> on mobiles as well as a large computer monitor is one of a few aspects I need to explore. Plus I don't notice any changes on my phone other than font-size.</p>
    <p>Not really focusing on font styles, color or other design issues as I'm still troubleshooting layout and CSS. So there's going to be a whole lot of ugly happening and I'm fine with that. Probably will move the <b>Version</b> section to the side and social media icons inline with <em>nav</em> buttons...or wait for Ruby.</p>
